###  MTA NY Subway data analysis 

This had been a really interesting project, also thank to the great teammates I was very lucky to work with: [Luc Demortier](http://lucdemortier.github.io), Ha Luu, and Gina Soileau.

It turns out that the most crowded Subway Station in NYC is 34 St. Penn!
And that Friday is much less crowded with respect to the other weekdays.
Short weeks in New York?

Check the ["benson_deliverables" folder](https://github.com/marcolunardi/metis/tree/master/benson_deliverables) into my Metis repository to get the Python code!

Analysis Tools: Python Dictionaries
