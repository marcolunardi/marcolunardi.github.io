###  Twitter in a glance  


This is something I needed very much, and then I made it myself.

This app gather the 200 most recent tweets from the account of your choice, and returns the 10 most used nouns into them,
along with the 10 most used combinations of 2,3 and 4 words.

This provides you with a quick view about the most present subjects into the chosen twitter account.

Once you got a view about all the recent tweets, you can now choose the noun of your interest (the keyword), and select just the tweets containing that noun.

The app then will return the 5 most used verbs, adjectives, nouns (excluded the keyword), and adverbs in order to 
likely compose a "most used sentence".

Along with that, the app will return the 5 most present combinations of 2,3, and 4 words used into the selected tweets.

This app is very useful to me in order to get a very quick view of the most clear trends developed through the day
into the main financial markets. I'm using it on a daily basis and it works quite well in giving me useful hints
in a very glance about the main trends on the financial markets. I used it mostly on Yahoo Finance and Market Watch Twitter accounts.

But it works also on accounts not related to financial matters.

Finally, this is the starting point of one out of the two projects I'm considering as my final project for the bootcamp.

Check the ipython notebook in "fletcher_deliverables" folder into my Metis repository to see the code of my app!

Very soon this notebook will be visible on NBViewer and I will add a flask app based upon the same notebook.
