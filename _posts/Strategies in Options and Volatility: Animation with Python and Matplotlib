###  Option Strategies and Volatility: an Animation Sample using Python and Matplotlib

When it comes to trading in options, you have to be aware that risk becomes “multidimensional”.
You will face risks coming from multiple variables: not just the price of the underlying asset, but also volatility, time, interest rates could harm your trading strategy.
And it’s not so obvious which of these variable has the biggest effect.
Obviously it can change depending upon the situation you have, but look at the wide effects of a sudden doubling of the implied volatility (not an usual event, but even not so rare).
A sold condor strategy like that displayed in the below video could more than halve its at now profits (all other things being equal) even when you are just two days away from the expiration date.

I know the graph is quite sketchy, but I intentionally wanted to show how, even by sticking to basic Python tools, some good viz stuff can be done.
