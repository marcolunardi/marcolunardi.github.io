### Data Science NY Bootcamp - Second Project about movie data! (Luther)


Do Academy Awards influence more the audience or theatres chains?
Is there proportionality between number of Nominations and number of Oscars wins?
What do audience actually favour? Nominated or award winner movies?

Check "luther_deliverables" folder into Metis repository on my Github to see my findings!
