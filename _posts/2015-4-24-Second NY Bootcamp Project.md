###  Movies data analysis 


Do Academy Awards influence more the audience or theatres chains?
Is there proportionality between number of Nominations and number of Oscars wins?
What do audience actually favour? Nominated or award winner movies?

Check ["luther_deliverables"](https://github.com/marcolunardi/metis/tree/master/luther_deliverables) folder into my Metis repository to see my findings!

Results are summarized into the PPTX presentation.

Analysis Tools: HTML, Web Scraping, Python Numpy and Pandas, Linear Regression
