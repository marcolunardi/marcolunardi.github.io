I am very passionate about data, using them to learn from the past and get better results into the future.

I apply my quantitative skills to financial markets modeling and investment funds managing, to get continuity in performances along with reduced volatility.

### More Information

I'm currently managing an hedge fund (long-short futures) and providing long-only stock trading advisory, with performances that since I started, almost 2 years ago, are comfortably better than those of the respective benchmarks.

I will post my certified track records here very soon!
